I present my first project in classic form -HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three musketeers helped me create a movies&series browser. It wouldn't have been successful if it wasn't for the API and video database - provided by TMDB.

The site allows you to search the video database, you can find videos by the genres, search by video titles. You can also add films or series to your library and remove them from there, for example after watching a video. The third section is to contact me :)

In addition, you can see what videos are currently playing, what movies are coming to cinema screens, what movies are the best rated and most popular. 

When you click on a video, details are displayed.



Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
