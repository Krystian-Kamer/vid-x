* I present my first project in classic form -HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a movies&series browser.
* My site has 3 sections - one with whole logic, second to see your selected movies & serise (so library) and third to contact me.
* This is full responsive website.
* You can toggle between movies or series - it's your choice. Specific genres will appear depending on whether you choose - movies or series.
* The site allows you to search the video database, you can find videos by the genres, also search by video titles. 
* You can also add films or series to your library and remove them from there, for example after watching a video!
* In addition, you can see what videos are currently playing, what movies are coming to cinema screens, what movies are the best rated and most popular. 
* When you click on a video, details are displayed thanks to modal.

* To recreate the site locally, just clone my repository and type npm install in terminal (just replace the API_KEY with yours).
* It wouldn't have been successful if it wasn't for the API and video database - provided by TMDB.

Feel free to explore my site and if You have any questions You can simply write to me.
